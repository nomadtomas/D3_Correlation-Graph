          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Consistent association was derived between lower income and higher smoking, leading to the assumption that smoking is more 
            prevelant amongst financially challenged individuals.  
          </p>

          <p>In the obesity perspective, it seems to show a significant correlation between higher income and lowered obesity.  This 
            pattern leads us to believe the higher income indiduals tend to spend more money on higher priced foods, which tend to be 
            nonprocessed.
          </p>

          <p>The impact financial stability has on healthy living seems to be quite significant.  However, this could also be added to the 
            notion that, higher income individuals also tend to have a higher education.
